M/M/1 and M/M/2 Queue Simulator
A Python-based simulator for M/M/1 and M/M/2 queuing systems to analyze metrics like queue length, response time, and server utilization.

Features
Simulates M/M/1 and M/M/2 systems.
Adjustable parameters: arrival rate (λ), service rate (µ), and servers.

Outputs:
Average queue length
Average response time
Server utilization

Theoretical vs. simulated comparisons with visualizations.
Usage
Open simulation-hw3.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Modify the parameters (e.g., arrival rate, service rate) in the notebook cells.
Run all cells to see:
Metrics and theoretical vs. simulated results.
Histogram and queue length plots.
Dependencies
Install required libraries:
numpy matplotlib
