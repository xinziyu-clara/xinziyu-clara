M/M/1 and M/M/2 Queue Simulator
A Python-based simulator for M/M/1 and M/M/2 queuing systems to analyze metrics like queue length, response time, and server utilization.


1. Features

1.1 Simulates M/M/1 and M/M/2 systems.

1.2 Adjustable parameters: arrival rate (λ), service rate (µ), and servers.

1.3 Outputs:

Average queue length

Average response time

Server utilization

1.4 Theoretical vs. simulated comparisons with visualizations.


2. Usage

2.1 Open simulation-hw3.ipynb.

2.2 Modify the parameters (e.g., arrival rate, service rate) in the notebook cells.

2.3 Run all cells to see:

Metrics and theoretical vs. simulated results.

Histogram and queue length plots.

3. Dependencies

Install required libraries:
numpy matplotlib
